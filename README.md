# asteroid-destroyer

## Overview
A very simple asteroid destroyer game I made because I was bored

## Features
- **Starship controls** It's really just a triangle that you can move
- **Shooting** The starship(triangle) shoots bullets 
- **Asteroids** There are 3 sizes for asteroids, and they split into 2 unless it's the smallest size

## Installation
I highly doubt you would ever wanna play this game, but:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements from **requirements.txt**
3. Run the game

## How to play
- Movement: Use WASD keys to move forwards, backwards and rotate
- Shooting: Press space to shoot
- Objective: Survive
